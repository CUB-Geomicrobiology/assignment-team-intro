# Introduction to Team Assignments

This is the `README` for the introductory team assignment. For a step-by-step guide on how to complete this assignment, please watch the video tutorial. This is a team assignment so all team members should contribute to it. If you do get stuck with any of the technical aspects surrounding the assignment (access, editing, branches, merging, etc.), see if one of your teammates can help you. If all else fails, please email the instructor for help.

## Setup

If you see this `README`, you have already successfully accepted the assignment and joined a team.

## Assignment

 1. Create a new branch for your edits
 2. Make edits in your branch:
    - copy the contents of the `team-member-EXAMPLE.md` file into a new `team-member-YOURNAME.md` file with your name
    - complete the assignment in the new `team-member-YOURNAME.md` file
    - edit the `team-assignment.md` file to make sure it links correctly to your `team-member-YOURNAME.md`
 3. Merge your branch back into the `master` (base = `master`)
 4. Fill out the rest of the `team-assignment.md` file together with your team (again, work in branches or coordinate who is editing the file).

## Submission

Once you and your team have completed the assignment, submit by creating a pull request from the `master` branch (not one of the individual branches!) with `submit` as the base branch and your instructor as the reviewer (revisit the first assignment tutorial - Intro GitHub - if you need a refresher how to do this).

## Grading

This assignment will be graded based on completeness and formatting (i.e. if you and your team fill out all questions, make sure the links work and files are cleaned-up, and submit it in time you get full marks). See the syllabus for information on the late policy for this class.

Criteria                                                       | Max  | Score
---------------------------------------------------------------|------|------
Team overview (completing `team-assignment.md`)                | 40%  |
Team member files (completing all  `team-member-???.md` files) | 40%  |
Formatting<sup>‡</sup>                                         | 20%  |
**Overall**                                                    | 100% |

<sup>‡</sup>: Formatting includes everything related to proper functioning of the assignment, i.e. that images show up correctly, links work properly, and that inline assignment instructions (the lines starting with ">") are removed from the final `team-assignment.md` and `team-member-???.md` files.
