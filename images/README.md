# How to upload images

1. Click on `Upload files`
2. `Choose your files` to select the image to upload. Make sure that images are not too big, a width of 600 to maximally 1200 pixels is typically plenty large. You can scale your image to these dimensions using any photo editing software. For example, a convenient free online tool for scaling images is available [here](https://www168.lunapic.com/editor/?action=scale).
3. `Commit changes` to add the image. Make sure you are in the correct branch (It should be saying *Commit directly to the `...` branch.* with the correct branch name underneath the `Commit changes` field).
4. Include your image in other files using the synax `![Image caption](images/IMAGENAME.jpg)` with the correct caption and image file name.
