# How to upload images

1. Click on `Upload files`
2. `Choose your files` to select the image to upload. Make sure that images are not too big, a width of 600 to maximally 1200 pixels is typically plenty large. You can scale your image to these dimensions using any photo editing software. For example, a convenient free online tool for scaling images is available [here](https://www168.lunapic.com/editor/?action=scale).
3. Commit your changes.
